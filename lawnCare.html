		  <img src="images/lawncare.jpg">
		  <p>Aeration is the process by which air is circulated through, mixed with or dissolved in a liquid. Soil aeration is the process of using mechanized or manual equipment to either puncture the soil with spikes (spike aeration) or remove approximately 1" x 2" cores of soil from the ground (core aeration). Aeration may be overlooked when trying to restore a lawn but is vital to bring it back to health.[citation needed] It improves drainage and reduces puddles formation. Seeding the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground, or broadcasting (from which the technological term is derived[citation needed]). Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. </p>

		  <p>A tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. A shrub (or bush, but this is more of a gardening term) is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. Shrubs can be deciduous or evergreen.</p>
