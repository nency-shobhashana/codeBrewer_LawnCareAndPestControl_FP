					Q.: What’s really IN fertilizer, anyway?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					We all know fertilizer is food for grass. But not everyone knows how it works or what the three numbers on bags of fertilizer mean, or what the components of fertilizer do for your grass. The three numbers on fertilizer labels show the percentage of each of the three most important plant nutrients. Those are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). So a 35-5-10 blend is thirty-five per cent nitrogen, five per cent phosphorus and ten per cent potassium. Nitrogen improves plant growth. Phosphorus stimulates the growth of new roots and helps with the strength of roots. Potassium strengthens the blades of the grass. It helps the grass resist traffic and disease pressure, and reduces moisture lost from evaporation. Polyon ultra high slow-release granular fertilizer is included in all of LawnSavers packages and can also be purchased separately.

				<div class="que">
					Q.: Do you offer mosquito control services
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					We do offer Mosquito Control in the GTA. Our mosquito spray treatment has been shown to reduce the mosquitoes in your yard up to 90% when part of a comprehensive treatment plan.  This mosquito control service repels these bugs for up to 21-30 days!

				<div class="que">
					Q.: Does Corn Gluten work effectively to control weeds in my lawn?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					Short answer: A little bit. It simply affects young seedlings from developing root systems (SOMETIMES). As a Fertilizer it will add nitrogen to the lawn to green it up. It is not considered a slow release fertilizer, it greens up fast and fades away fast too. As a Crabgrass Management tool, it needs to be a registered product for this purpose. It must be applied at double the rate to get any benefit for crabgrass prevention. Dr. Christian’s studies and others, show it takes 2-3 years of applications to get to about 50-60% control of crabgrass. THAT’S REALLY LOW, and not normally noticeable since crabgrass plants can easily put out hundreds of seeds per individual plant, every year!”
