					Q.: What’s kind of fertilizer you use for soil?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					We user Organic fertilizer and Organic fertilizers are fertilizers that are naturally produced and contain carbon (C)[1]. They meet the Principles of Organic Agriculture, whose main objective is to feed the ecosystem as a whole, which includes the soil, microbes, and the community at large, not just the crops. Organic fertilizers include mineral sources, all animal waste including meat processing, manure, slurry, and guano, plant based fertilizers, such as compost, and biosolids[2]. There are also other abiotic non-chemical, fertilizer methods that still meet the Principles of Organic Agriculture.

					Q.: What is a Insect repellent?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					An insect repellent (also commonly called "bug spray") is a substance applied to skin, clothing, or other surfaces which discourages insects (and arthropods in general) from landing or climbing on that surface. Insect repellents help prevent and control the outbreak of insect-borne (and other arthropod-bourne) diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever, bubonic plague, river blindness and West Nile fever. Pest animals commonly serving as vectors for disease include insects such as flea, fly, and mosquito; and the arachnid tick[citation needed]. Some insect repellents are insecticides (bug killers), but most simply discourage insects and send them flying or crawling away. Almost any might kill at a massive dose without reprieve, but classification as an insecticide implies death even at lower doses.

					Q.: What is in mosquito control service?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>

Mosquito control is a vital public-health practice throughout the world and especially in the tropics because mosquitoes spread many diseases, such as malaria and the Zika virus.

					Q.: Mosquito-control operations over come which issue?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					Mosquito-control operations are targeted against three different problems: Nuisance mosquitoes bother people around homes or in parks and recreational areas; Economically important mosquitoes reduce real estate values, adversely affect tourism and related business interests, or negatively impact livestock or poultry production; Public health is the focus when mosquitoes are vectors, or transmitters, of infectious disease.

					Q.: Do you give Lawn mower service and what is benifits?
				</div>
				<div class="ans">
					<b>Answer: </b>
					A lawn mower (also known as mower, grass cutter or lawnmower) is a machine utilizing one or more revolving blades to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the design of the mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically one cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; "walk-behind" mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled "walk-behind" types, or more often, are "ride-on" mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it.
